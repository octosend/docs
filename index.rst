Welcome to the Octosend documentation project
============================================

.. _Octosend: https://octosend.com/

`Octosend`_ is an innovative solution for big players to send a huge number of
emails directly in the recipients inboxes.

The core concepts of `Octosend`_ are **multi-routing** and **scoring** to manage
all of your email communication needs, either **marketing email campaigns**,
**transactional emails**, **trigger campaigns** and more.

For more information on the product's features, go see the `Octosend`_ landing page
or feel free to contact us at hello@octosend.com. We are eager to get feedbacks and
questions, whatever can help us improve our product, and we also love a good and
relaxed chat sometimes.

**Several interfaces** allow you to access the product features and this documentation
aims to guide you through the (we hope easy and we do everything we can for that !)
task of integrating and using the service whatever your needs are.

You need to know some informations and to get an account in order to get started.
More on that in this introductory guide:

* :ref:`getting-started`

Then you can get your hands dirty. We aim to ease the usage of our work and thus
offer different ways to use `Octosend`_. Those interfaces can be separated in regards
of two users profiles:

* :ref:`developer-docs`
* :ref:`user-docs`

The developer documentation is for people who wants to use the features from their
own softwares and GUI (at least for some parts of the product) while the user documentation
aims to open all the `Octosend`_ features to people who just want to take a quick
look or don't have the time or the development skills to have their own tools to
manage their email campaigns.

But first things first, you need to complete some steps in the :ref:`getting-started`
before to dive in the integration of our cool features.

  We try to open publicly as much as we can of the product and work hard to release
  quality code, features, and *in fine* product. If you like who we are, the way
  we work, on what we work and want to help us and divert yourself by contributing
  for whatever reason you can possibly have, please do it and come to see us.

  The publicly available parts are all released on the project github account
  https://github.com/octosend (we will always share new things with the community)
  including this documentation and you can contribute either on the documentation
  project, on the already existing projects or propose a new one. You can also help
  us by opening issues and tickets. Thanks!
